# ABOUTME: Usage: aws-vault exec curtail -- ./sync-assets.sh [pull|push]
#
# Clips, music and voiceovers are gitignored because they are large binaries, so
# a fresh clone cannot rebuild any video without them. They live in
# s3://curtail-shares/video-assets/ instead, which is private: that bucket only
# grants CloudFront access to public/*, so nothing here is reachable from a CDN.
#
# pull  fetch what this checkout is missing (what you want after cloning)
# push  upload what you have changed (after re-cutting a clip or re-recording)
#
# Neither direction deletes. Removing an asset is deliberate enough to be done by
# hand, and a stray delete here would destroy the only copy of a recording.
